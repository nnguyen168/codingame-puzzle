# CodinGame puzzle solutions

CodinGame's purpose according to their [website](https://www.codingame.com/about/team): "At CodinGame, our goal is to let programmers keep on improving their coding skills by solving the World's most challenging problems, learn new concepts, and get inspired by the best developers."

I have been looking for a perfect platform for learning programming, somewhere between not too hard and not too easy, where I can commit 15 minutes everyday on it. I found CodinGame's approach suitable for developers from novice to advanced, and their game-based challenges will stop you from getting bored.

I create this repository to keep track of my solution of all the puzzles I have ever conquered. It is never too bad to look back to your solutions and try to understand as well as improve it. The only language I use at the moment is Python 3, but I will welcome any solutions on other languages such as Java or C++ as I also want to work on those.

The puzzles are divided into four categories: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard. More and more companies use CodinGame as a platform for hiring developers, and most of the questions coming from Easy and Medium challenges. Therefore working on these puzzles before hand will give you a good practice for your coding interview.

Here is the list of all challenges in this repository (to be updated regularly):
